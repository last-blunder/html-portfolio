<h1>Movie Ranking List </h1>
<h2>My top 5 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h2>List</h2>
<h3>1.Dr Strangelove</h3>
<p>It is a cautious story adapted in Stanley Kubricks film. It tells how doing a small mistake
can eventually end the world. 
<br />
<h5>Deterrance is the art of ... producing in the minds of enemy, a fear to attack.</h5>
is my favourite line.
</p>
<h3>2.Shutter Island</h3>
<p> This is my next favourite. It is a psychological thriller which gives you a choice to decide between the fate of film,
    despite its clear ending favouring one choice, the other choice would seem so compelling. In this story, two marshals
    uncover mysteries of mental institutionary... Thats what she said.
</p>
<h3>3.The Kingdom of Heaven</h3>
<p> It is a wonderful movie showing powerful values, ethics, and how strong are one's moral will and those set by 
    society(primarily religions) This movie is just too good.
    The metaphors, ideas make it a treasure.  
</p>
<h3>4.The Fight club</h3>
<p>
    David Fincher's best... Must watch.
</p>
<h3>5.Goodwill Hunting</h3>
<p>
   Movie centers a genius, who flees and doesnt face some of his emotional problems(say, traumas of past), finds the strength
   when a psychatric philosopher opens up a conversation with him.
